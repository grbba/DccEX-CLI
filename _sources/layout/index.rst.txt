Describing your layout and what you can do with this
====================================================

In order to allow for setting up your layout and initalize operations and execute automations we need a way on how to represent a layout for making it 
understandable to the commandstation as well as enable dataexchange between commandstations and any other (to come) equipement.

There are existing formalisms like RailML but they are for real railroads and that was the only thing i came accross but which is by no means friendly 
and usable for model railroads. In the following we describe the ideas on how to descibe a layout, the schema together with a set of examples and what
you can do with it.

An outline of the roadmap is as well available to possibli generalize the usage of such a schema across the community.
