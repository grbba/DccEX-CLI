Summary
-------

As its name implies DccExCli is a terminal application running on a Linux or MacOs terminal or Windows CMD or PowerShell. 
In a nutshell it allows you to interact with your Arduino based Dcc-EX CommandStation. Uploading, managing or operations: All is
possible by different means of connectivity.

What you need to do? Follow some simple instructions and you should be up and running in no time. Simple instructions as the Dcc-EX 
team already managed to minimize setting up the hardware. Know how to put LEGO together ? Well then you can build the CommandStation )

Why are you asking yet another program I have JMRI, Arduino IDE, VisualStudio Code with the PlatformIO extension 
etc. etc. to get things running. For most of the time you will need the Arduino IDE or the VSC/PIO combo
for getting:

1. The commandstation code compiled and loaded onto the Arduino. 
2. The serial monitor to interact with the commandstation for either programming or operations.

That all looks very initimidating and even for the seasoned developper it can be a hassle sometimes to get everything setup and configured. So there should be a silution providing enough
freedom for the tinkerers and engineers around but most of all some simple tool to get running quickly for conductors - Don't know what
they look like, well head over to the DCC-EX website.

The DCC++ EX Commandline Interface allows to install/manage/configure your DCC++EX commandstation as well as your layout in an oldfashioned 
typewriter way of working. It come handy but doesn't replace a full UI APP etc of today. It's the premises of something much bigger to come. 

But in reality the idea of building the commandline Interface came form a different angle. Rediscovering modelrail roading after +20y gone by i found myself in a 
whole new world. At the same time everything now despite being digital seems a magnitude of order more complicated. The Market is completley fragmented, Providers
have hard time to agree on any standard not even speaking of implementing on what they agreed upon. Digital Command and Control was invented by engineers for engineers.
UX and Design Thinking have been words probably never been heard of when this all was invented so now we have to cope with CVs as modelrailsroaders where we actually 
only should talk the registration of a Locomotive and all the other ancronyms comming with it. I have got the impression sometimes that
you have to have a Computer Science Degree if not PhD to be able to run a model rail road which shouldn't be the case. - The rant stops here -

So I want to take out all the technology speak of the user expirience and make all that more palpable for everyone more intersted in trains rather 
than digital electronics. Ahh then go buy one of those commercial systems you may say and yes why not if you got all the money at hand and still
want to fight all the tech talk on top of most likely to keep things easy be locked into a single vendor. There is no reason and its just an
excuse imho not being able to step back and propose something usable by the vast majority of people and only catering to the 1% who want to push everything to
the limit and aren't satisified who things are done now. That way of thinking is absolutley necessary to thrive inovation etc but should inhibte
the fact to deliver something easy and straight forward to use. 

Having read this you may be disappointed of what follows indeed the vision is still a long way to go and maybe I am completley wrong 
and everyone in the model rail road community is just happy as things are today. 

Let's try to make things simpler. One step after the other.
